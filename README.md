# Second Order Volterra Variational Autoencoder (V2VAE)
This repository contains the implementation of the VOLterra VariatiOnal autoencoder, i.e. a variational autoencoder where the decoder is a Volterra filter.
The work is based on the VAE for equalization of communication systems [1, 2].

Check out our paper which is currently a preprint:
